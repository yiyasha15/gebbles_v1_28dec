          <!-- InMyGroove is a community platform <b>to celebrate the each one teach one legacy of the hiphop culture </b> in a meaningful way. 
          We all learn from some artists who passionately shared their dance and knowledge, may be in the studios, streets, clubs or cyphers. We hope, like us
          you too understand the value of their sharing along the way which made you a dope dancer today. Let's celebrate them and share your experiences with them.
          Eventually a new generation dancer will get to know them through you.<b> The cycle of the culture repeats and along the way comes your turn, to be celebrated by your students.</b>
          The past, present and future of each one teach one becomes one right here. You see it right. Let's make the culture even more meaningfully connected than it is today. 
          We feel that together we can acheive this hence the initiative <b>'Inmygroove', where you represent yourself, your journey and your teachers/friends/brothers/sisters
          who passed a part of their groove, a part of their soul to you.</b> -->
